On Deck.js the anchor doesn't work the same as HTML. 
At each slide deck.js create an anchor named "slide-X" where X is the number of the slide (we begin at 0). 
I am a visitor, I will visit a document and return a Dictionary with all the anchors of a document in key and the number of the slide where is the anchor as value.

I work with the "slideInTemplateForDeckJS" configuration to know how many slides I have before the document in the template.

currentSlide is the number of the current slide.

anchorMapping is the dictionary of anchor/counter.
