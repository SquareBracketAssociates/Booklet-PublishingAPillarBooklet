I am an abstract class to describe a Phase of an export. 
A Phase takes an input, transforms it and returns an output.

A phase holds a configuration. This configuration is a  the configuration of the export.

To create a new phase you have to define its prority as a class method then to define the action of the Phase with a method actionOn: anInput. This method will return an output. 
You can also add some transformations to the output like: 

transformerInputFileOn: aCollection
	<pillarTransformer: 1> "the parameter is the priority of the transformation"
	aCollection
		do: [ :each | 
			PRFileInclusion new
				configuration: self configuration;
				start: each ]
