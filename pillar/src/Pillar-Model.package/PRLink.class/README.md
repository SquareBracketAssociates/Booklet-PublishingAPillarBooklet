I am an abstract link built from an alias and a reference. The alias is the string representation that will be displayed to the user, whereas the reference is a string identifying the target. If there is no alias, the reference itself is displayed. Links can try to embed the referenced target into the containing document.

!Examples
=*Reference*
=+Alias>Embedded Reference*
