I can keep track of the count of nested structures so each structure as its own number. For exemple, 2 sections in Chapter 1 would have a counter of #(1 1) and #(1 2). The first number indicates the top-most structure (here a chapter), while the following numbers represent the nested structures. I can count up to a max level.
