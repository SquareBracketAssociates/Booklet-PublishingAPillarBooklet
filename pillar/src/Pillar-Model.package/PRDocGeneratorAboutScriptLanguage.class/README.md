I generate a documentation about the different script languages from class which inherit from PRRealScriptLanguage.

PRDocGeneratorAboutScriptLanguage new generateDoc
>>>
 "'- PRBashScriptLanguage which tag is: bash
- PRCSSScriptLanguage which tag is: css
- PRHTMLScriptLanguage which tag is: html
- PRHTTPScriptLanguage which tag is: http
- PRJSONScriptLanguage which tag is: json
- PRJavaScriptScriptLanguage which tag is: javascript
- PRPillarLanguage which tag is: pillar
- PRSQLScriptLanguage which tag is: sql
- PRSTONScriptLanguage which tag is: ston
- PRShellCommandsScriptLanguage which tag is: shellcommands

'"

SD questions: I do not really get how script are handled.
