!!About Pillar

Pillar is a system to manage documents (books, presentations, web sites). It is able to emit resulting documents in multiple formats (html, markdown, latex, AsciiDoc). 
It is composed of several modules such as importers, transformers, document model and outputers.

This book describes Pillar in its current version 7.0. Pillar is currently developed and maintained by StÃ©phane Ducasse and Guillermo Polito. 
The original author of Pillar was Damien Cassou. Many people have also contributed to Pillar: Ben Coman, Guillermo Polito, Lukas Renggli (original author of Pier from which Pillar has been extracted), Benjamin van Ryseghem, Cyril Ferlicot-Delbecque, Thibault Arloing and Yann Dubois.

Pillar is sponsored by *ESUG>http://www.esug.org*.


!!! Introduction

Pillar (hosted at *http://github.com/pillar-markup) is a markup language and associated tools to write and generate documentation, books (such as this one) and slide-based presentations. The Pillar

Pillar has many features, helpful tools, and documentation:
- simple markup syntax with references, tables, pictures, captions, syntax-highlighted code blocks;
- export documents to HTML, LaTeX, Markdown, AsciiDoc, ePuB and Pillar itself, and presentations to Beamer and Deck.js;
- customization of the export through a dedicated STON configuration file (see chapter *@cha:ston*) and Mustache templates (see chapter *@cha:mustache*).
- many tests with good coverage (94% with more than a 2100 executed tests), which are regularly run by a *continuous integration job>https://ci.inria.fr/pharo-contribution/job/Pillar*
- a command-line interface and dedicated plugins for several text editors: *Emacs>https://github.com/pillar-markup/pillar-mode*, *Vim>https://github.com/cdlm/vim-pillar*, *TextMate>https://github.com/Uko/Pillar.tmbundle*, and *Atom>https://github.com/Uko/language-pillar*
